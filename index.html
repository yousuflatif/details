All parts of American infrastructure are in a dismal state. 
They are old, worn, and there isn’t enough money to revitalize it. The problem can be seen all around us, from the clogged, cracked highway system to the inadequate water quality (Flint, MI anyone?), to the old public transit system. 
The terrible conditions are not just the opinions of regular people either. The organization called the <i>American Society of Civil Engineers </i> (ASCE) is a group of civil engineers who studies and observes America’s infrastructure to gauge the condition it is in. 
Every four years, they release a report card on the condition of the infrastructure in America, also broken down by specific category. The report card is based on the regular school scale (A-F), and the last report card was published in 2017. America’s infrastructure was graded horrendously. 
The overall grade for infrastructure was a D+, with the individual breakdown even more bleak. The ASCE divides infrastructure into sixteen categories, and of those sixteen, ONE category (railway system) was given a grade in the B range. <b>Every other category</b> was graded from C+ to D-, with those categories on the border of total collapse. 
Some highlights (or should I say lowlights) include: a D in drinking water, a D- in public transit, a D in public schools, and a D+ in the disposal of hazardous waste. These sorts of grades are not even close to acceptable if this was a school, so why should they be when it is in an area which affects <b> almost every single American? </b>
This problem needs an immediate solution, for the good of the American people.
